          description: My main role is to analyze the fiscal policy of the Federal Government of Brazil. During my time at the Treasury, I supported the development of a model that predicts the expenses of the Brazilian Pension System under different rules, which influenced the final Pension System Reform enacted in 2019 by the Brazilian Congress, and created an economic model that uses historical data and current conditions to predict the expected daily cash flow of the Brazilian federal government in a four-month window.

            <p align="justify"> This paper studies a society where different groups compete over control of the economic agenda and wealth is regarded as a source of social status and political power. I conclude that, under these assumptions choices, optimal individual choices can lead to a suboptimal economic situation for every player. I also suggest ways in which better institutions can be used to improve the efficiency of the result.

            The majority of the world is going through a demographic transition in which the population is getting older, a change that will affect the way our society organizes itself. This paper studies the effects the demographic's aging has on innovation, and therefore productivity and economic growth. I show that the effects on general productivity are visible in Macroeconomic data and use microdata on Innovation provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) to measure the effect that older workers can have on innovation.
